This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}

data(golub)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.


1. Some questions to orientate yourself.
(a) Use the function class to find the class to which the follow-
ing objects belong: golub, golub[1,1],golub.cl, golub.gnames,
apply, exp, gol.fac, plot, ALL.
(b) What is the meaning of the following abbreviations: rm, sum, prod,
seq, sd, nrow.
rm = remove 
sum = Gaußsche Summe
prod = Fakultät
seq = sequenz von x bis y
sd = standard deviation (Standardabweichung)
nrow = Zeilenanzahl einer Matrix


(c) For what purpose are the following functions useful: grep, apply,
gl, library, source, setwd, history, str.

grep - get data value where grep is true
apply - applies a function like a for loop on all values specified in matrix 
gl - to simulate experimental data with #ofpatients and #ofcases
library - to load a library into r
source - run the script
setwd - set or get working directory - i use here
history - shows history of commands
str - displays structure of an R object




```{r}
class(golub)
class(golub[1,1])
class(golub.cl)
class(golub.gnames)
class(apply)
class(exp)
class(gol.fac)
class(plot)
class(ALL)
str(golub)
```
2. gendat Consider the data in the matrix gendat, constructed in Sec-
tion 1.6. Its small size has the advantage that you can check your
computations even by a pocket calculator. 14
(a) Use apply to compute the standard deviation of the persons.
(b) Use apply to compute the standard deviation of the genes.
(c) Order the matrix according to the gene standard deviations.
(d) Which gene has the largest standard deviation?
gene 2


```{r}
gendat
apply(gendat,2, sd)
gene_sd <- apply(gendat,1, sd)
o <- order (gene_sd, decreasing = TRUE)
gendat[o,]


```
3. Computations on gene means of the Golub data.
(a) Use apply to compute the mean gene expression value.
(b) Order the data matrix according to the gene means.
(c) Give the names of the three genes with the largest mean expression
value.
(d) Give the biological names of these genes.

```{r}
golub_means<-apply(golub, 1,mean)
o <- order(golub_means, decreasing = TRUE)
golub[o,]
golub.gnames[o,3]
names(golub.gnames)
```
